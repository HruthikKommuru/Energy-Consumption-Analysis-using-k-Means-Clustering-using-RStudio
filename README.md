##  K-Means Clustering for Energy Consumption Pattern Segmentation (using R)

This project focuses on segmenting regions or time periods based on energy consumption patterns using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.

**Dataset:**

This project utilizes a dataset containing consumption records, weather data, and regional demographic information.

**Variables:**

* **date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* **time:** Time in format hh:mm:ss
* **global_active_power:** Household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* **global_reactive_power:** Household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* **voltage:** Minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
* **global_intensity:** Household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* **sub_metering_1:** Energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy) for kitchen appliances.
* **sub_metering_2:** Energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy) for laundry room appliances.
* **sub_metering_3:** Energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy) for water heater and air conditioner.

**Objectives:**

* **Understand and segment energy consumption patterns.**
* **Identify trends and anomalies in energy consumption.**
* **Uncover opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.**

**Project Breakdown:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Organize and clean the dataset for clustering analysis.
    * Handle missing values and potential inconsistencies.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Develop features relevant to energy consumption patterns (e.g., daily consumption, peak hours).
    * Analyze the impact of weather data and demographics (if applicable).

3. **Clustering Analysis:**
    * Implement K-Means clustering to segment data based on consumption patterns using relevant R packages.
    * Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using evaluation metrics.

4. **Interpretation of Clusters:**
    * Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each identified cluster.
    * Identify patterns within clusters and potential outliers.

5. **Deliverables:**
    * Processed data ready for clustering analysis.
    * Well-documented K-Means clustering model (R code).
    * Cluster analysis report with insights and interpretations.
    * Recommendations for energy management strategies based on clustering results.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required R packages (e.g., dplyr, tidyr, cluster).
3. Refer to the project R scripts for detailed instructions.
